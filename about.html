              <strong>Cooking</strong> is one of my beloved hobbies, where I
              find solace in the kitchen, experimenting with diverse flavors and
              techniques. It's a creative outlet that allows me to unleash my
              culinary imagination.

              Maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle is of utmost importance
              to me. <strong>Working out</strong> not only keeps me physically
              fit but also enhances my mental well-being. I prioritize
              incorporating exercise into my routine to stay energized, focused,
              and ready to tackle any challenge.

              As an avid <strong>movie enthusiast</strong>, I find great joy in
              immersing myself in the world of cinema. Exploring different
              genres and analyzing storytelling and cinematography bring me
              immense pleasure. I appreciate the artistry behind every film and
              enjoy discussing and sharing my insights with fellow movie buffs.

              <strong>Reading</strong> holds a special place in my heart, as it
              nourishes my mind and transports me to captivating realms. It's
              not just a source of knowledge and personal growth, but a gateway
              to new perspectives and exciting narratives. I indulge in books
              across various genres and cherish the immersive experience they
              provide.

              I'm currently focusing on

                >Meta Front End Certification
              </a>
              by Coursera, which I completed on July 5, 2023. The certification
              has enhanced my understanding of software development
              fundamentals, including the roles of front-end and back-end
              developers. It provided insights into
              <strong>web functioning</strong>, the <strong>significance of HTTP</strong>, emphasized the
              <strong>importance of UX design</strong>, and offered hands-on
              experience with real-world projects utilizing
              <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>,
              <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>.
              Next up, I'll be pursuing the Meta Back End Certification.

              This summer, I am determined to enhance my
              <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="skills.html"
                >skills</a
              >
              by pursuing Meta front-end and back-end certifications in order to
              prepare for next year's internships. Recognizing that
              problem-solving and algorithmic techniques naturally improve with
              time, I have made the decision to pursue a computer science
              degree. I firmly believe that this degree will provide me with a
              solid foundation that is essential for a successful career as a
              <strong>software developer</strong>.
