# Personal website
## My first summer project that will involve me to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make my personal website.
## Personal CSS and JavaScript
``` Check out the "first version" folder to see my personal CSS inside the "olderInitial" folder.```

## Using Different frameworks
Need to improve mobile experience of the website.
Works well on iPad but not iPhone.
