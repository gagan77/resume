# Personal website
## My first summer project that will involve me to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make my personal website.
Building using Bootstrap and focusing on responsive building. Also focusing on using best practices in design.

## Personal CSS and JavaScript
Check out the "resume-last-version" folder to see my personal CSS inside the "olderInitial" folder.

## Using Different frameworks
Need to improve mobile experience of the website.
Works well on iPad but not iPhone.

## Next steps make the website using React
This will allow to make this website as a Single Page Application.
